            Remote learning has led many Wellesley students to seek a quality study environment and opportunities to build connections with classmates from Zoom classes. Our app prototype, StudySib, aims to address the challenge of less effective at-home study environments and difficulties forming friendships online through the following key features:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> Group study rooms where students can study on call together with classmates</li>
            <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> A customizable self-study space</li>
            <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> Friend Finder tool where students can match with others looking for friends to study with</li>

<!-- User Analysis -->
    
<section id="about" class="about">
  <div class="container">
    
    <div class="row content">
      
        <h2>User Analysis</h2>
        <u><h3>Takeaways from User Interviews</h3></u>
        
        <h4>User A</h4>
        <p>User A is an undergraduate student studying remotely at home in California and they feel very isolated from their peers and as though they have made no real friends this semester. They feel uncomfortable reaching out to people to study over Zoom direct message and feels that arranging to study at a set time over Zoom with a peer feels too orchestrated and formal. These days, Student A listens to music to focus while studying but they usually prefer to study with friends in a cafe. They make an effort to go to bonding events facilitated by her professors for their students, such as movie and trivia nights, in hopes of getting to know new people. Student A also appreciates how being put in random breakout rooms frequently is another opportunity to meet many new people. In one of their classes, the professor asks an icebreaker question at the beginning of classes each day, which wasn’t a habit prior to having Zoom classes, and Student A really appreciates this practice. They mainly use Zoom and Google Docs to collaborate with others, which they strongly dislike, but will continue to use those platforms because they cannot find anything better.</p>
        <h4>User B</h4>
        <p>User B is an undergraduate student studying abroad in London and feels that they aren’t able to make close friendships in their classes and misses the spontaneity of talking to people in person because it takes less mental effort to reach out. They also find it hard to gauge their classmates' vibes and overall personality based off of Zoom classes alone, outside of seeing their background if they even have their camera on at all. User B generally feels awkward private messaging individuals during synchronous Zoom classes, but tends to befriend and approach others who also participate frequently; they usually bond with others during "noteworthy" moments that happen on call. They also find that they are more engaged with others when professors actively try to foster connection and promote conversation during classwork. As a result, they have been able to make a few new friends from Zoom classes and they usually hang out in person to study or go to pubs. User B usually uses WhatsApp and Slack to meet others in her class and schedule in-person meet ups.
        </p>
        <h4>User C</h4>
        <p>User C is an undergraduate student studying in New York City and feels dissatisfied with Zoom friendships as they are unable to connect with people as deeply virtually compared to in-person. They usually see anywhere from 12-800 people in their classes, but feel that friendships from Zoom classes will not last. They find studying alone very ineffective and distracting and it is difficult to concentrate while studying by themself in their room. They hear that their friends are also having a hard time concentrating on studying by themselves so sometimes they meet up to study in a park. However, User C appreciates the fact that having Zoom classes prevents name-mix-ups that would otherwise happen with in-person learning as everyone has their name displayed on Zoom. User C usually uses Instagram DM to communicate with classmates outside of class, so they see classmates' Instagram profiles when they reach out to them, which gives them a sense of classmates’ personalities and lifestyles.

      <u><h3>Scenarios</h3></u>
      <div class="row content">
        <h4>Scenario 1: A Wellesley student looking to create a more effective studying environment</h4>
         <p>Wanda feels that studying alone remotely is ineffective and distracting. Since classes turned remote, she stays in her apartment alone to do her assignments and studies primarily at her desk in her bedroom. She misses the ability to work in common spaces or cozy coffee shops, with a buzzy atmosphere. She finds she’s not able to concentrate on her work as easily. She is seeking a way to recreate a communal studying experience (akin to being in a common or public space) from the safety of her home. She decides to try going on StudySib, and uses the Self Study option to set the ambience and music of her study environment to recreate the experience of being at a coffee shop at home.
        </p>
        <h4>Scenario 2: A Wellesley student looking to form friendships </h4>
        <p>Wendy misses the casual and spontaneous nature of making friendships through in-person classes. She feels that remote classes do not nurture genuine friendships and that those relationships often feel forced and will not last past the semester. She is looking for a more effective way to form genuine friendships in a remote learning environment. After class, Wendy logs on to StudySib, clicks on Friend Finder, and matches with other students with similar intentions of conversing and forming friendships. After matching with another student, she messages them using an ice-breaker prompt generated by the app.
        </p>
        <h4>Scenario 3 - A Wellesley student looking to join a group study session remotely
        </h4>
        <p>Wendy has a hard time choosing someone to reach out to while in her synchronous remote classes. Some students don’t have their cameras on, and others don’t speak during class at all. These factors make it difficult for her to gauge who might be interested in socializing and studying with peers. After class, Wendy logs on to StudySib, clicks on the Group Study page to see available study rooms. She joins a room, to see there are several students conversing and working. She introduces herself to everyone and then begins working with them on the homework assignment, occasionally taking breaks to chat about random topics.
        </p>

      <u><h3>Design Directions and Rationale</h3></u>

      <h4>Design 1</h4>
      <div class="col-lg-6">
      <img src="assets/img/designH.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Design 1 sketch home">
    </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <img src="assets/img/selfH.PNG" class="img-fluid" alt="Design 1 sketch solo study">
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <img src="assets/img/tinderH.PNG" class="img-fluid" alt="Design 1 sketch friend finder">
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <img src="assets/img/studyH.PNG" class="img-fluid" alt="Design 1 sketch group study">
      </div>
      <p>This is the first preliminary design of our user interface. It consists of three modes: study, social, and self-study. This design mainly utilizes icons to maintain a sense of visual aesthetic and it focuses on user satisfaction with its interactable elements— most notably the dating-app-inspired feature for making friends.</p>      
      
      <h4>Design 2</h4>
      
        <img src="assets/img/designB.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Design 2 sketch homepage">
      
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <img src="assets/img/selfB.PNG" class="img-fluid" alt="Design 2 sketch solo study">
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <img src="assets/img/groupB.PNG" class="img-fluid" alt="Design 2 sketch group study">
      </div>
      <p>This is the second preliminary design of our user interface. It consists of two modes: solo and group. This design mainly focuses on learnability and efficiency as it relies on text and labels to guide users through the app, which leaves minimal room for confusion as to what each button leads to.</p>      

    <u><h3>Summary of takeaways from in-class design review session</h3></u>
    <p>Based on our in-class design review session, we had the following takeaways and changes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>Guidelines to establish expectations for social etiquette - To address the issue of ensuring Wellesley students are informed about the social expectations of participating on our platform (e.g. being kind to each other, no discrimination), we decided to add a page of guidelines about appropriate use that all users will be taken to immediately after sign-up</li>
      <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>Greater transparency for joining a group study room - To address the uncertainty that can come with entering a virtual space, we wanted to add a preview for the rooms. The preview would include 1) list of occupants 2) the “vibes” of the room in the form of an emoji to describe the mood (e.g. relaxed or very focused) 3) whether or not they’re on study break 4) the ability to ‘lock’/’unlock’ a room to indicate if anyone could join it</li>
      <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>More fun, Wellesley-specific features, such as a map of campus to represent the virtual study rooms - Before, we just had a bunch of rooms that students could join. We decided to make this more engaging by making all the ‘rooms’ a part of a larger map representing buildings on Wellesley campus</li>

    </div>
    <div class="row content">
      <p></p>
      <p>The original design direction that we decided to go in consists of three pages: one for making friends, 
        one for group studying, and one for studying independently. Our original name was Etude, the French word for studying. 
        We later decided to change the name to be more simple and friendly. 
        The page for making friends follows a Tinder-like 
        system of swiping left and right based on a quick biography. The page for group studying features a 
        map of different buildings on campus, represented by various icons, and users can select the location on 
        campus that they would like to study in based on what topic they are studying for. For example, someone 
        looking to study computer science would select the Science Center, where they can find other existing rooms 
        with students that are also studying computer science. There also is the option to preview rooms based on
         an emoticon and the number of people in the room; we considered giving a video preview of the room, but 
         ultimately decided against it because it somewhat infringes on the privacy of those using the room. All users 
         can also choose to lock or unlock their rooms at any time if they are comfortable with the dynamic in the room 
         or if they want to change the dynamic. We also decided to 
         add a page of guidelines about appropriate use that all users will be taken to immediately after sign-up. Since 
         this app is Wellesley-exclusive, we decided that users will need to provide their Wellesley email, name, major, 
         time zone, and a fun fact in order to sign up for an account on this app. We also considered adding a host 
         feature that would restrict the ability to lock and unlock a room to one designated host but we ultimately 
         decided against it. The reasoning behind this decision is because in real life, anyone can lock or unlock in a 
         physical room and unlike Zoom, where the professor is obviously the host, there is no “obvious host” for users 
         using this app as all students are technically equals.

        <img src="assets/img/p4/ss.png" class="img-fluid" alt="StudySib solo study">
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>For our prototype, we chose a color scheme of dusty blue, pastel coral, dandelion yellow, oatmeal beige, and shades of white, black, and grey. The reasoning behind this choice was because it’s a relaxing set of colors that doesn’t include any bright or neon colors that may be overwhelming to users. It’s also accessible because it passes the color blind test and there are no contrast errors. We decided to use “Open Sans” and “Arimo'' as the primary fonts because it’s simple and accessible. We utilized a simplistic map to avoid confusion from users and icons are solid colored and simple so that it’s easier on users’ eyes and easy to interpret. We focused on establishing a balance of white space and text and graphic design on a page so that it would be relaxing and not overwhelming to look through. We decided to focus on increasing learnability on our website through maintaining both internal and external consistency. We accomplished internal consistency by having each page have similar colors, fonts, and layouts. For external consistency, we utilized a menu taskbar on the bottom of the homepage that allows you to navigate to different pages. We also maintained consistency by having all similar items be grouped together.
