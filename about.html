        <h2>User Analysis</h2>
        <h3>Takeaways from User Interviews</h3>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
        <h4>User A</h4>
        <p>Stuff</p>
        <h4>User B</h4>
        <p>User B is an undergraduate student studying abroad in London and feels that they aren’t able to make close friendships in their classes and misses the spontaneity of talking to people in person because it takes less mental effort to reach out. They also find it hard to gauge their classmates' vibes and overall personality based off of Zoom classes alone, outside of seeing their background if they even have their camera on at all. User B generally feels awkward private messaging individuals during synchronous Zoom classes, but tends to befriend and approach others who also participate frequently; they usually bond with others during "noteworthy" moments that happen on call. They also find that they are more engaged with others when professors actively try to foster connection and promote conversation during classwork. As a result, they have been able to make a few new friends from Zoom classes and they usually hang out in person to study or go to pubs. User B usually uses WhatsApp and Slack to meet others in her class and schedule in-person meet ups.
        </p>
        <h4>User C</h4>
        <p>User C is an undergraduate student studying in New York City and feels dissatisfied with Zoom friendships as they are unable to connect with people as deeply virtually compared to in-person. They usually see anywhere from 12-800 people in their classes, but feel that friendships from Zoom classes will not last. They find studying alone very ineffective and distracting and it is difficult to concentrate while studying by themself in their room. They hear that their friends are also having a hard time concentrating on studying by themselves so sometimes they meet up to study in a park. However, User C appreciates the fact that having Zoom classes prevents name-mix-ups that would otherwise happen with in-person learning as everyone has their name displayed on Zoom. User C usually uses Instagram DM to communicate with classmates outside of class, so they see classmates' Instagram profiles when they reach out to them, which gives them a sense of classmates’ personalities and lifestyles.

      <h3>Design Directions and Rationale</h3>

      <u><h4>Design 1</h4></u>
      <div class="col-lg-6">
      <img src="assets/img/designH.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Design 1 sketch home">

      </div>
      <p>This is the first preliminary design of our user interface. It consists of three modes: study, social, and self-study. This design mainly utilizes icons to maintain a sense of visual aesthetic and it focuses on user satisfaction with its interactable elements— most notably the dating-app-inspired feature for making friends.</p>      
      
      <u><h4>Design 2</h4></u>
      
        <img src="assets/img/designB.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Design 2 sketch homepage">

      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <img src="assets/img/groupB.PNG" class="img-fluid" alt="Design 2 sketch group study">
      </div>
      <p>This is the second preliminary design of our user interface. It consists of two modes: solo and group. This design mainly focuses on learnability and efficiency as it relies on text and labels to guide users through the app, which leaves minimal room for confusion as to what each button leads to.</p>

        <h2>Interactive prototyping & evaluation</h2>
    </div>
    <h3>First Wireframe Prototype</h3>
    <div class="row content">
      <video poster="assets/img/preview1.png" controls>
        <source src="assets/video/p3.mp4" type="video/mp4">

      </video>
    </div>
    <div class="row content">
      <p></p>
      <p>The original design direction that we decided to go in consists of three pages: one for making friends, 
        one for group studying, and one for studying independently. Our original name was Etude, the French word for studying. 
        We later decided to change the name to be more simple and friendly. 
        The page for making friends follows a Tinder-like 
        system of swiping left and right based on a quick biography. The page for group studying features a 
        map of different buildings on campus, represented by various icons, and users can select the location on 
        campus that they would like to study in based on what topic they are studying for. For example, someone 
        looking to study computer science would select the Science Center, where they can find other existing rooms 
        with students that are also studying computer science. There also is the option to preview rooms based on
         an emoticon and the number of people in the room; we considered giving a video preview of the room, but 
         ultimately decided against it because it somewhat infringes on the privacy of those using the room. All users 
         can also choose to lock or unlock their rooms at any time if they are comfortable with the dynamic in the room 
         or if they want to change the dynamic. We also decided to 
         add a page of guidelines about appropriate use that all users will be taken to immediately after sign-up. Since 
         this app is Wellesley-exclusive, we decided that users will need to provide their Wellesley email, name, major, 
         time zone, and a fun fact in order to sign up for an account on this app. We also considered adding a host 
         feature that would restrict the ability to lock and unlock a room to one designated host but we ultimately 
         decided against it. The reasoning behind this decision is because in real life, anyone can lock or unlock in a 
         physical room and unlike Zoom, where the professor is obviously the host, there is no “obvious host” for users 
         using this app as all students are technically equals.
